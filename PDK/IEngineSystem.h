/** \defgroup enginesystem   IEngineSystem
* This interface can be used to implement a custom engine/propulsion system plugin, and still allow other 
* core aircraft subsystems to interact appropriately with the custom engine system.
* A sample implementation using this interface can be found in the MyEngine sample in the PDK General Samples.
* \remarks 
* - Engine indexes are 0-based.\n\n
* - To enable a custom engine system plugin on a native aircraft, set in the aircraft.cfg or sim.cfg:\n\n
*   [GeneralEngineData]\n
*   EngineSystem = {bc95b363-1d22-42aa-82b1-f10905b22c40}\n
*   engine_type = 2\n\n
*   Where,\n
*   - engine type = 2 indicates to P3D to not create any core engine implementations\n
*   - The EngineSystem guid must match the service ID (SID_) of the subsystem factory registered at DLL load 
*     with the PDK. See the MyEngine sample.
